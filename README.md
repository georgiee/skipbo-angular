# Skipbo in Angular
This project is for learning purposes and not meant to hurt any copyright. All assets are made by myself.

[Live Example](https://georgiee.github.io/skipbo-angular)

+ Use Drag and Drop.
+ Game Rules are enforced through exceptions.
+ Discarding switches to the next player.
+ Oscar üêô will play for all CPU players after you discard
+ You see it's your turn by looking at the hotpink border
+ Angular Animations for the flipping animation
+ Guard to protected from entering and leaving the game.

I created a [workshop](https://github.com/georgiee/angular-workshop-skipbo) where we build this project over six chapters. You can try it out yourself.

## What's in the box ?
1. Rules of the games are implemented with a few core classes found in [src/app/skipbo-core](src/app/skipbo-core) with a set of specs. See my original project [skipbo-typescript-jest](https://github.com/georgiee/skipbo-typescript-jest)

2. Angular application is only consuming the output of the core in the shape of lists of cards through GameService which is really only a small and ugly facade for now.

3. I created all assets with Sketch and got the idea about the layout from the [official game app ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmic.googleplay.skipbo.free&hl=en).

4. Oscar üêô  will play for the Non-Human Players or for everyone if you want. He follows the game rules but is not that smart (yet!) ü§ì
